                        The very first step in this checklist is to decide if
                        you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming
                        headsets.
                        <br></br>So what is the difference between gaming
                        headphones and gaming headsets? <br></br>Gaming Headphones

                        music enjoyment. <br></br>However, they possess qualities
                        that are awesome for gaming needs too. <br></br>Audiophilic

                        them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming
                        headphones. <br></br>However, most audiophile headphones do
                        not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment
                        slots. <br></br>You will need to get an external mic like
                        the Blue Yeti X for communication support. <br></br>A
